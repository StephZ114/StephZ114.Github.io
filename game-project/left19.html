<center><h5>The Wii U, released by Nintendo in 2012, is a home video game console and the successor to the Wii. It features a unique controller called the GamePad, which includes a touchscreen and allows for asymmetric gameplay. The Wii U supports HD graphics and has a library of games that includes popular titles like "Super Mario 3D World," "Mario Kart 8," and "Splatoon." Despite its innovative features, the console struggled with marketing and competition, leading to lower sales than anticipated. It was discontinued in 2017, paving the way for the Nintendo Switch.<h5></center>
