It was the first iPhone to feature an edge-to-edge OLED display, known as the Super Retina display, and eliminated the physical home button in favor of Face ID facial recognition technology. The phone offered dual 12 MP rear cameras for enhanced photography, improved battery life, and wireless charging capabilities. With its sleek design and advanced features, the iPhone X set a new standard for smartphones and significantly influenced the design of future models..<h5></center>
