<h1>Apple Pie</h1>	

<p>
Apple pie is a time-honored treat that warms the heart. It starts with a golden, flaky crust, cradling a sweet filling of freshly sliced apples from the orchard. We sprinkle in some sugar and a dash of cinnamon—just enough to bring out the natural sweetness. There’s nothing like pulling a warm pie from the oven after a long day in the fields. Serve it up with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and you’ve got a slice of home right there. It’s a simple pleasure that brings family and friends together, especially during harvest time.<p>
